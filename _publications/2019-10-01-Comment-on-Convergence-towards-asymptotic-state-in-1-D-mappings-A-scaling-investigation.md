Nonequilibrium phase transitions are characterized by the so-called critical exponents, each of which is related to a different observable. Systems that share the same set of values for these exponents also share the same universality class. Thus, it is important that the exponents are named and treated in a standardized framework. In this comment, we reinterpret the exponents obtained by Teixeira et al. [1] for the logistic and cubic maps in order to correctly state the universality class of their bifurcations, since these maps may describe the mean-field solution of stochastic spreading processes.
