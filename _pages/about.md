Welcome to the NeuroPhysics Lab, where we apply tools from Physics and Mathematics to model, understand and analyze data from brain recordings, behavioral experiments, and neural networks. We propose data-driven theories (_i.e.,_ inspired by empirical data), but also develop original theoretical models and predictions about these complex systems.
