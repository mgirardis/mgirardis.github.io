Explore the connection of dynamical systems in neural modeling. Delve into reduced one- and two-dimensional neural models, examining their intricacies and behavior in phase-space analysis. Uncover the phenomena of subthreshold oscillations, the canard phenomenon, and resonance, both subthreshold and suprathreshold. The course also delves into the intriguing dynamics of bursting in neural systems.
