Study of the equilibrium conditions of particles and rigid bodies (structures, beams, trusses, etc.) in the 2D and 3D, involving the calculation of reactions in standard connections and supports used in engineering; calculation of axial forces, shear forces, and bending moments in structures and beams; calculation of centroids of areas and volumes of simple and composite figures; calculation of moments of inertia of simple and composite flat plates and simple and composite solids; cable equilibrium.

Objectives
======

Develop the ability to analyze and solve engineering problems based on the fundamental principles of Newtonian mechanics, formulating precise mathematical expressions and deriving conclusive results.

By the end of the course, the student should be able to:
* Apply static equilibrium conditions, both in particles and rigid bodies, to solve practical engineering problems.
* Calculate internal forces at any point in simple structural elements.
* Plot shear force and bending moment diagrams for beams subjected to simple loads.
* Calculate centroids of areas and volumes of simple and composite figures.
* Calculate the moment of inertia of flat plates and simple solids.
